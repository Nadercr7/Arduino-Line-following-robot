# Arduino-Line-following-robot
### This project showcases the code and setup required to build a Line Following Robot using an Arduino. The robot autonomously follows a predefined path (typically a black line on a white surface) using sensors and motor controls.
Overview

A line-following robot uses infrared (IR) sensors to detect a line and steer accordingly. The robot adjusts the speed and direction of its wheels based on sensor input, ensuring it stays on the track.
Components

    Arduino Uno (or any compatible microcontroller)
    L298N Motor Driver (to control the motors)
    DC Motors (2 or 4 depending on the robot design)
    Infrared (IR) Sensors (to detect the line)
    Chassis (for mounting all components)
    Wheels and Caster Wheels (for smooth movement)
    Power Supply (batteries or an external power source)
